StokesDiffEq.jl is a component package in the DifferentialEquations ecosystem. It holds the
solvers for Stokes-type PDEs. Users interested in using this
functionality should check out [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl).
Note that currently this package is underdeveloped compared to the rest of the
JuliaDiffEq ecosystem.
